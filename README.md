# NeuroRehack-Project-1

low-cost visual feedback system for neuro-rehabilitation exercise verfication and report generation.

# Usage

Run the python program with 'record' or 'compare' argument. In record mode, you'd need to provide the action's folder name as well. By default it is set to 'action1'.

```
python op_webcam.py record --folder=action2
```

The expected folder structure is:
- recordings
  - action1
    - recording_timestamp.json
    ...
  - action2
